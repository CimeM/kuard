# Storage solutions

# Persistent volume 
K8s knows how to create a storage disk with Persistent Volume:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
...
```

# Statefull sets

- Similar to ReplicaSets
- each replica gets its hostname
- when deleted each replica gets deleted from highest to lowest

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 80
    name: web
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: nginx

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx # has to match .spec.template.metadata.labels
